# Mezzanine Webfaction

Fabric file and related resources for deploying a [Mezzanine] project to a
Webfaction shared hosting account.

## Installation

Download `fabfile.py`, `fabsettings.py`, `wsgi.py` and `deploy/` to your
Mezzanine project folder, replacing them if they already exist.

## Pre-requisites

### In your dev machine
- Mezzanine
- Django
- Fabric
- A git repo with your project files
- A pip requirements file

### In your Webfaction account
- pip
- virtualenv
- supervisor
- Git app
- memcached

*Note: this script can install the server pre-requisites for you.*

## Usage

**YOU MUST INSTALL THE PRE-REQUISITES IN YOUR SERVER FIRST!**

1. Copy the contents of `fabsettings.py` to `local_settings.py` and tweak to
   your liking. This is the only file you have to edit, all others will be
   populated by Fabric. All available settings are explained in
   `fabsettings.py`. **These settings are different from those provided in
   `settings.py` by Mezzanine, so make sure you only use the ones provided by
   `fabsettings.py`.**
1. Run `fab prepare_webfaction` to prepare your account for hosting your
   projects. You only need to run this task once for each account. All
   subsequent projects can skip this step.
1. In your dev machine and in your project directory run `fab all` to setup
   everything for your project in the server. `fab all` simply calls `fab
   create` and the `fab deploy:first=True`. It basically sets up your project
   environment and then deploys it for the first time.
1. Subsequent deployments can be done with `fab deploy`. If you use `fab
   deploy:backup=True`, Fabric will backup your project database and static
   files before deploying the current version of the project.
1. You can setup up a cronjob for polling Twitter with `fab setup_twitter`.
   Make sure you define `TWITTER_PERIOD` in your deploy settings first.
1. If you want to wipe out all traces of the project in your server: `fab
   remove`. Calling `fab remove:venv=True` will also delete the virtualenv
   associated to the project.
1. Get a list of all available tasks with `fab --list`.

## FAQ

#### How is this different from the default Mezzanine fabfile?
This fabfile is based on the one provided by Mezzanine, but includes several
tweaks to make it work in a shared hosting environment.

- `sudo` is never used since Webfaction accounts don't have this privilege.
- The Webfaction API is used heavily to fully automate the deployment. This
  includes creating domain and site records, apps, databases and cronjobs.
- The server-wide Nginx installation is used via a static app, instead of
  defining custom Nginx config files.

#### How is this different from the [Webfaction tutorial on installing Django]?
Deploying with Fabric has several advantages over the method provided by
Webfaction:

- Fully automated. No need to login to the control panel at all. This was the
  main reason I created this fabfile, to speed up the transition from
  development to production on my client's projects.
- Uses Gunicorn as the application server instead of Apache.
- Installs everything according to Django best practices, instead of creating a
  Django App in the control panel which is hard to mantain up to date.
- Uses South and can also automate database and static files back ups.
- Uses supervisor for managing processes, wich is tidier than a cronjob for
  each Apache instance.

#### Why are you using a symlink to a static/php app instead of one to a static-only app?
Because by doing so you can specify expiration dates for static assets in
`.htaccess` in your root static directory. This prevents browsers from
requesting all your assets every time. [Rationale], [Question in QA site]. You
can change the static app from `symlink54` to `symlink_static_only` if you
wish.

#### How come I'm seeing three processes running for each Mezzanine project?
Gunicorn uses a master process and a configurable number of worker processes to
serve a site. The [Gunicorn docs] recommend this number should depend on the
amount of processor cores, however, in my tests with my 16-core Webfaction
server this results in 33 processes, which quickly eats all my RAM. I've
hardcoded 2 processes in `gunicorn.conf.py` and all seems well. Feel free to
modify this number to your needs.

#### What exactly is the fabfile doing?
I recommend you take a look into the source to wrap your head around each task,
but here is a quick run through them:

1. If you use `fab prepare_webfaction` it will install and configure all pre-
   requesites. This includes setting up an account-level pip, virtualenv and
   supervisor installation. A supervisord conf file is created and [memcached
   is started] with an allocation of 50 Mb. A [git application] named "git" is
   created in `~/webapps/git`. All repos will live in there.
1. A full project setup with `fab create` will create a new virtualenv, set up
   a remote git repo and add it to your local git repo as "webfaction", create
   a site, database, a custom app, and a static app with the Webfaction API,
   and install all your project dependencies in the venv. It will create a site
   record in the project db and a superuser if you define `ADMIN_PASS`.
1. `fab deploy` pushes all your changes to the remote repo, collect's static
   files and restart's the gunicorn process via supervisorctl.

## Known issues (please contribute!)

- Tested only with Python 2.7, Django 1.5, and Mezzanine 1.4.
- No support for MySQL.
- No support for Mercurial, SVN.
- You can only deploy to one Webfaction server and only to one domain.
